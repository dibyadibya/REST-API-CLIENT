Overview

This Java application consumes a public REST API to fetch weather data and displays it in a structured format. The application uses the java.net.HttpURLConnection class to send HTTP requests and the org.json library to parse JSON responses.

Features

- Fetches weather data from a public REST API
- Parses JSON responses and extracts relevant data
- Displays weather data in a structured format
Instructions

1. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.
2. Compile and run the Java program.
3. The program will display the weather data for London.
